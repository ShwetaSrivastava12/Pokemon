Data Loading and Initial Inspection
The script starts by loading the "Pokemon.csv" dataset into a pandas DataFrame. It then displays the first 10 rows of the DataFrame to get an initial look at the data structure.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
The script converts all column names to uppercase and replaces any underscores with an empty string, ensuring consistent column naming. It identifies and prints the column related to "LEGENDARY" Pokémon. It then displays the first 5 rows of legendary Pokémon, followed by setting the 'Name' column as the DataFrame's index. The script then modifies the index to remove any text preceding "Mega" in Pokémon names (e.g., "VenusaurMega Venusaur" becomes "Mega Venusaur"). Finally, it drops the 'Total' column, as it's likely a sum of other stats, and prints the updated column list and DataFrame shape.

Handling Missing Values
The script fills any missing values in the 'Type 2' column with the corresponding value from the 'Type 1' column. This suggests that if a Pokémon doesn't have a secondary type, its primary type is used as a fallback.

Data Access and Filtering
The script demonstrates various ways to access data within the DataFrame using both label-based indexing (.loc[]) and integer-based indexing (.iloc[]). It then filters the DataFrame to display Pokémon that are primarily 'Fire' or 'Dragon' type, and secondarily 'Dragon' or 'Fire' type, showing the first 3 results. It also identifies and prints the Pokémon with the maximum 'HP' and 'Defense' values.

Data Aggregation and Exploration
The script sorts the DataFrame by the '#' column in descending order and drops duplicate 'Type 1' entries, keeping only the first occurrence for each type. It prints the unique Pokémon types found in 'Type 1' and the total count of unique types. It also displays the counts of each 'Type 1' and 'Type 2' to understand the distribution of Pokémon types. A summary of the numerical columns (count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max) is generated using df.describe().

Data Visualization
The script generates several visualizations to explore the Pokémon data:

A histogram of 'ATTACK' values, showing the distribution of attack stats with a vertical line indicating the average attack value.

A scatter plot comparing the 'Attack' and 'Defense' stats of the first 50 'Fire' and 'Water' type Pokémon. Fire-type Pokémon are marked with stars and colored red, while Water-type Pokémon are marked with circles and colored blue.

A pie chart illustrating the percentage distribution of different Pokémon types based on 'Type 1'. The 'Other' category consolidates less frequent types.

Box plots are used to visualize the distribution of 'HP', 'ATTACK', 'DEFENSE', 'SP. ATK', 'SP. DEF', and 'SPEED' stats across all Pokémon.

Violin plots are used to show the distribution of 'ATTACK' and 'DEFENSE' stats for each 'Type 1' and 'Type 2' respectively, providing a richer view of the data distribution than box plots.

A violin plot showing the distribution of Pokémon by 'Generation' and '#', potentially indicating the spread of Pokémon numbers across generations.

A correlation heatmap displays the correlation coefficients between numerical stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed, Generation). This helps identify relationships between different Pokémon attributes.

Line plots illustrate the number of Pokémon of specific types ('Water', 'Fire', 'Grass', 'Dragon', 'Normal', 'Rock', 'Flying', 'Electric') across different generations.
